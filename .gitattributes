AI-Enabled Healthcare Diagnosis System
-Introduction
Diseases can have an impact on an individual's bodily and mental well-being, significantly altering their way of 
life, diagnosis is defined as the process of determining which disease a person has based on their symptoms 
and indicators. Due to errors in the diagnostic process, patients may have major health difficulties and have 
their proper treatment delayed or ignored. This is because diagnosing diseases is the most difficult process. 
Unfortunately, not every medical professional is an expert in every area of the field. therefore, the use of AI in 
clinical care is no longer in its infancy and is expected to experience exponential growth in the coming years. 
and the next five years will be critical for hospitals and health systems to build the infrastructure needed to 
support AI technology. AI-Enabled Healthcare Diagnosis Systems can be a great way to improve patient 
outcomes and reduce healthcare costs while also improving patient outcomes. 
-Objectives
The objective of our project is to develop an AI-Enabled Healthcare Diagnosis System that can enhance the 
online learning experience by incorporating innovative features. The system will be designed to provide 
accurate diagnoses and treatment recommendations based on medical data analysis. The system will also be 
integrated with electronic health records (EHRs) to improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. 
We see this as an important step in developing an AI-Enabled Healthcare Diagnosis System, which will 
positively affect the patient outcomes and support the successful of AI-enabled systems in primary care.

7-Risk Assessment:
While AI-Enabled Healthcare Diagnosis System offers a number of possible benefits, there also are several 
risks:
ï‚· Injuries and error. The most evident risk is that AI systems may make mistakes from time to time, and 
that patient injury or other health-care problems may result. If an AI program gives a patient the 
incorrect medication recommendation, overlooks a tumor on a radiological scan, or assigns a hospital 
bed to one patient over another because it predicted wrongly which patient would benefit more, the 
patient could be injured. 
ï‚· Privacy breaches: Artificial intelligence is trained on large data sets which may involve personal 
information.
ï‚· De-humanising healthcare: If artificial intelligence starts making health actions without a professional 
in the loop, there is a risk of de-humanising healthcare and generating distrust in patients towards 
recommendations.
